This directory contains the Flutter engine's third-party dependencies,
except for:

  //base, which is required to be at the root of the repository, and
  which is pulled in as part of the build system.

  //dart, which is also at the root of the repository, and which is
  also pulled in as part of the build system. We plan to eventually
  merge the Dart and Flutter repositories so it is not conceptually a
  "third_party" package.

  //mojo, which contains our local copy of the Mojo SDK. Mojo is part
  of the same overall project as Flutter, and they used to be in the
  same repository.

There are other third_party directories in the fully expanded
repository (as it stands after you've run the build system). The
following are brought in by our dependencies:

  //base/third_party
  //dart/runtime/observatory/web/third_party
  //dart/runtime/third_party
  //dart/third_party
  //mojo/public/third_party
  //third_party/android_tools/ndk/sources/third_party
  //third_party/skia/platform_tools/android/third_party
  //third_party/skia/third_party
  //third_party/tcmalloc/vendor/src/third_party

The following are historical and will be moved to //third_party in due
course:

  //tools/android/asan/third_party
  //tools/valgrind/asan/third_party
  //buildtools/third_party

To help build some of the third_party tools, we have build files in
the following directories:

  //build/secondary/third_party
  //dart/build/secondary/third_party

The latter are not actual third-party packages, they are tools for
building the third-party packages.
