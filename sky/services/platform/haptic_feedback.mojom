/// intentionally terse since it invokes default platform behavior. It is not

/// peripherals.

  /// Platform Specific Notes:
  ///       iOS: Uses the platform "sound" for vibration
  ///            (via AudioServicesPlaySystemSound)
  ///   Android: Uses the platform haptic feedback API that simulates a short
  ///            a short tap on a virtual keyboard.
  ///
  /// Return Value:
  ///   boolean indicating if the intent to provide haptic feedback to the user
  ///   was successfully conveyed to the embedder. There may not be any actual
  ///   feedback if the device does not have a vibrator or one is disabled in
  ///   system settings.
