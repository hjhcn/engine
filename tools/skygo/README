sky_server instructions
#######################

Building locally:
1. cd sky/tools/skygo/linux64 (or your current platform)
2. go build ../sky_server.go

Testing locally:
1. Build as per the above steps
2. Run test_sky --path-to-server /absolute/path/to/sky/tools/skygo/sky_server

Uploading the locally built server
1. cd sky/tools/skygo/linux64
2. upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket mojo sky_server

upload_to_google_storage.py is in depot_tools. It will overwrite
sky_server.sha1. Include that change in your code review.

linux64/sky_server was last built using go version go1.4.2 linux/amd64.
