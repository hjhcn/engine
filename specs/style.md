Sky Style Language
==================

For now, the Sky style language is CSS with the following restrictions:

- No combinators
- Only = and ~= attribute selectors
- Lots of other selectors removed // TODO(ianh): list them
- Floats removed
- Lots of other layout models removed // TODO(ianh): list them
