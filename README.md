[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/domokit/sky_engine.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/domokit/sky_engine)

Sky is a new way to build high performance, cross platform mobile apps.
More specifically, Sky is a rendering engine, a scripting engine, an
(optional) framework, and an (optional) set of [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) widgets.
Sky is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are focused
on low-latency input and high frame rates on Android and iOS.
