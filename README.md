Sky
===

Sky is a new way to build high performance, cross platform mobile apps.
More specifically, Sky is a rendering engine, a scripting engine, an
(optional) framework, and a (optional) set of Material Design widgets.
Sky is optimized for today's, and tomorrow's, mobile devices. We are focused
on low-latency input, high frame rates, and we are purely mobile first.

 - For information about using Sky to build apps, please see
   [Getting Started with Sky](sky/packages/sky/README.md).
